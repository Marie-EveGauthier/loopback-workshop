** List all entries ordered by first name

{"order":"firstName ASC"}


** List the first 10 entries ordered by last name

{"order":"lastName ASC", "limit" : 10}


** List the second "page" of 10 entries ordered by last name

{"limit": 10, "skip": 10, "order" : "lastName ASC"}

** List all entries where the first name is "John"

{"where": {"firstName": "John"} }

** List all entries where the first name contains "John"

{ "where": {"firstName": {"regexp": "John"} } }


I did the first ones from entry model. For the two last one, I did it from the addressBook model.
**List all address books including their entries

{"include": {"entries"}

**List all address books including their entries, as well as all the addresses, emails and phone numbers associated

{"include": {"entries": ["addresses", "emails", "phones"]}}
